# RvtBcfApiExampleClient

Revit C# .NET API add-in implementing
the [BuildingSMART](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org)
[BCF API](https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-API) example client.

It is based on the existing [BcfApiExampleClient](https://github.com/rvestvik/BcfApiExampleClient).

This sample was motivated by
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160) thread
on [support for BCF API](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/support-for-bcf-api/m-p/6304397).

Please also note the [comment](https://github.com/rvestvik/BcfApiExampleClient/issues/2) by Georg Dangl saying,
'In December we had another Hackathon in Munich where Veni Lillkall created
a [small sample app in C#](https://github.com/BIMit/BCF-Hackathon-Munich/tree/Team_C%23).
This might give you some ideas how to use the BCF API itself.'
